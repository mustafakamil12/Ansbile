======================================================== Ansible For absolute beginner ===========================================



================================================================ Introduction ====================================================

# Why Ansible:
	i. Provisioning
	ii. Configuration Management
	iii. Continuous Delivery
	iv. Application Deployment
	v. Security Compliance

# There many of examples that Ansible really can be the most powerfull tool to use with:
	i. if u have many web servers and database servers, you need to reboot these servers, u can write a play book to start power off the web servers first and then power off the database servers and then power on db servers and then web servers.

	ii. another good one, if u have a complex infrastructure that span cross public and private clouds running 100's of vms. u can easly spin vms in both clouds as well u can connect Ansible to db or service now so it will spin up asap.

# all recoired info are in: https://docs.ansible.com/

================================================================== Setup Lab =====================================================

# we will use VirtualBox to set the lab.
	i. we will create multiple vms for the lab
		- Template: will be used to create the other requierd vms
		- Ansible controller
		- target01
		- target02
	ii. we will use pre installed and pre configured virtual images on --> osboxes.org

	iii. in the osboxes select VM Images --> VirtualBox Images --> CentOS --> download the latest version and 64
		- Username: osboxes
		- Password: osboxes.org
		- Root Account Password: osboxes.org

	iv. configuration:
		- Name: centos-template
		- type: linux
		- version: other linux 64
		- Memory: 2048 MB
		- processor: 2
		- network: bridge

	v. clone from the template:
		- Name: ansibel-controller / ansible-target1 /ansible-target2
		- path: /Users/mustafaalogaidi/VirtualBox VMs
		- Mac Address Policy: Generate new MAC address for all network adapters
		- Linked Clone

	vi. change host name
		- sudo vi /etc/hostname --> ansiblecontroller
		- sudo vi /etc/hosts    --> host ansiblecontroller
		- sudo shutdown now -r

	vii. install ansible on the controller
		- sudo yum install epel-release
		- sudo yum install ansible
		- ansible --version
